# calculator-app-project
Developed a responsive calculator web application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application includes a user-friendly interface, styled buttons, and a display screen, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience.

**Key Learnings and Skills Gained:**
**JavaScript Fundamentals**: Gained hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts, such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and function usage to implement calculator logic.
**Responsive Design:** Learned to create responsive layouts using CSS, making the app adaptable to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
**Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling skills by managing potential calculation errors to provide reliable outputs.
**Project Structuring and GitHub:** Improved skills in organizing and structuring a project for version control and deploying it on GitHub.

This project strengthened my problem-solving abilities and understanding of front-end development, showcasing my ability to build functional, interactive applications with attention to user experience.
